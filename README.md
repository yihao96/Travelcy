# Travelcy
A website for booking flights and hotels (incomplete project)

This is an assignment for XML & Web Services module as a part of my course BSc in Information Technology with specialism in Mobile Technology in Asia Pacific University.

This is a RESTful web application developed using ASP.NET Core 2.2, Ocelot, and Vue.js.

The application has 2 parts; 1 for backend and 1 for frontend.

Ocelot was used as the gateway for routing to the microservices developed for this project.
All the microservices was developed using ASP.NET Core 2.2, C# programming language.
The frontend part was developed using Vue.js.
Axios was used to allow XHttpRequests from frontend to backend.
Data was saved in XML file.

The microservices/API was tested on Postman to ensure all the RESTful APIs are working as expected.

A partial demo of the web application is available here: https://youtu.be/RfbA68u2lL8
